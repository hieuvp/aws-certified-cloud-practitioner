## 1. The Network is Reliable

> Calls over a network will fail.

## 2. Latency is Zero

> Calls over a network are not instant.

## 3. Bandwidth is Infinite

> Bandwidth is limited.

## 4. The Network is Secure

> The network is insecure.

## 5. Topology Doesn't Change

> Network topologies change constantly.

## 6. There is One Administrator

> There is no one person who knows everything.

## 7. Transport Cost is Zero

> Transport cost is not zero.

## 8. The Network is Homogeneous

> The network is not homogenous.
