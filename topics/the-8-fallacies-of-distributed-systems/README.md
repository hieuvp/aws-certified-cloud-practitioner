## The Network is Reliable

> Calls over a network will fail.

## Latency is Zero

> Calls over a network are not instant.

## Bandwidth is Infinite

> Bandwidth is limited.

## The Network is Secure

> The network is insecure.

## Topology Doesn't Change

> Network topologies change constantly.

## There is One Administrator

> There is no one person who knows everything.

## Transport Cost is Zero

> Transport cost is not zero.

## The Network is Homogeneous

> The network is not homogenous.
